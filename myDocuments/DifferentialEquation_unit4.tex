\subsubsection{Operator Notation}

If $y_1$ and $y_2$ are two solutions to a homogeneous, linear differential equation
\begin{equation*}
  \ddot y + p\dot y + qy = 0,
\end{equation*}
Why is $c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$ a solution?\\

You know superposition for linear homogeneous differential equations.
We want an elegant proof because it will help us with more complicated problems,
including solving higher order inhomogeneous equations.\\

\paragraph{An elegant proof of superposition}
The superposition principle says exactly that if $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solution to a  linear homogeneous ODE. \\
\footnote{in fact, it can be of higher order too, In other words, you don't have to stop
with a second derivative. You could add a third derivative and fourth derivative.
As long as the form remained the same, then that implies, automatically, that $c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2$
is a solution.}
Now the way to do that nicely is to take a little detour and talk a little bit about
{\color{blue}linear operators}.
And since we're going to be using these for the rest of the term, this is the natural place for you
to learn a little bit about what they are.
So I'm going to do it.
Ultimately, I am aimed at a proof of this statement, but there are going to be certain side
excursions I have to make.\\

The first side excursion is to write the differential equation in a different way.
So I'm going to just write its transformations.
So first, I'll simply recopy it, 
\begin{equation*}
  \ddot y + p\dot y + qy = 0. 
\end{equation*}
That's the first form. \\
The second form, I'm going to replace this by the differentiation operator $D$
\begin{equation*}
  D^2 y + pDy qy = 0, 
\end{equation*}

$D^2$ means differentiate it twice. $D$ it, and then $D$ it again.
$D$ means only have to differentiate once, so I'll write that as $p Dy$, $p$ times the derivative of $y$.\\
Now I'm going to formally factor out the $y$.
\begin{equation*}
  \left( D^2 + pD + q \right)y = 0 
\end{equation*}
So this I'm going to turn into $D^2 +  pD + q$.
Now everybody reads $D^2 +  pD + q$ times $y$ equals $0$.
But what it means is $(D^2 + pD + q)y$ means this is shorthand for
$D^2 y + pDy qy$.
I'm multiplying $q$ times $y$, but I'm not multiplying $D$ times $y$.
I'm applying $D$ to $y$. \\
And now I'll take the final step.
I'm going to view $(D^2 + pD + q)$ as a guy all by itself, a {\color{blue} linear operator}.
This is called a linear operator.
And I'm going to simply abbreviate it by the letter $L$.
And so the final version of this equation
\begin{equation*}
  Ly = 0
\end{equation*}

\clearpage
Now what's L? You could think of L as
\begin{equation*}
  L = D^2 + pD + q 
\end{equation*}

But you can think of L the way to think of it is as a black box.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image-linear_operator}
  \caption{Linear Operators}
\end{figure}

What goes into this black box? Well if this were a function box, what
would go in would be a number and what would come out would be a number.
But it's not that kind of a black box. It's an {\color{blue} operator box}.
And therefore what goes in is a function of $x$, and what comes out is another function of $x$,
the result of applying this operator to that.\\
So from this point of view, trying to solve the differential equation means what should come
out, you want to come out 0 and the question is what should you put in?
That's what it means; solving differential equations in an {\color{blue} inverse problem}.
The easy thing is to put in a function and see what comes out.
You just calculate. The hard thing is to ask.
You say, I want such and such a thing to come out, for example, $0$.
What should I put in? That's the difficult question.
And that's what we're spending the term answering.\\

Now the key thing about this is that this is a linear operator
and what that means is that it behaves in a certain way with respect to functions.
The easiest way to say it is, I like to make two laws of it,
\begin{align*}
  L(u _1 + u _2 ) &= L(u_1) + L(u_2)
  \text{ Where } u _1 \text{ and } u _2 \text{ a function of } x \\
  L(c u) &= c L(u) \text{ Where } c \text{ is a any constant. } 
\end{align*}
These are the two laws of linearity.
An operator is linear if it satisfies these two laws.
Now for example, the differentiation operator is such an operator; D is linear.
Why?
\begin{align*}
  (u _1 + u _2)' &= u' _1 + u' _2 \\
  (cu)' &= c u' 
\end{align*}

All that was a prelude to proving this simple theorem, the superposition principle.
So finally, what's the proof?
Well, proof of the superposition principle, if you believe that the operator is linear,
in other words, the ODE is $L$.
$L$ is $D^2 +  pD +  q$. So the ODE is $Ly = 0$.
And what am I being asked to prove?
I'm being asked to prove that if $y _1$ and $y _2$ are solutions,
\begin{align*}
  L(c_1 y _1 + c_2 y_2 \footnotemark) &= L(c_1 y _1) + L(c _2 y _2) \\
                                      &= c _1 L(y _1) + c _2 L(y _2) \\
                                      &= c _1 0 + c _2 0 = 0                                        
\end{align*}
\footnotetext{
  $c_1 y _1 + c_2 y_2$ called a linear combination.
  This expression is called a linear combination of $y_1$ and $y_2$.
  It means that particular sum with constant coefficients.
}
I'm trying to prove that this is $0$.
Well, what is $L(y _1)$?
At this point, I use the fact that $y_1$ is a solution.
Because it's a solution, this is $0$. That's what it means to solve that differential equation.
It means when you apply the linear operator $L$ to the function, you get $0$.
In the same, way $y _2$ is a solution. So that's $0$. 
That's the argument.
Why it's so is because the operator, this differential equation, is expressed as a linear operator applied
to $y$ is $0$.
And the only properties that are really being used is the fact that this operator is linear.
That's the key point. $L$ is linear.
It's a linear operator.\\

\textbf{\color{blue} The operator $D$}
\begin{itemize}
\item A function takes an input number and returns another number.
\item An {\color{blue} operator} takes an input \textbf{function} and return another function. 
\end{itemize}

For example, the {\color{blue} differential operator} $\frac{d}{dt}$ takes an input function
$y(t)$ and returns $\frac{dy}{dt}$.
This operator is also called {\color{blue} $D$}.
For instance $De^{4t} = 4e^{4t}$. The operator $D$ is {\color{blue} linear} ,
which means that
\begin{equation*}
  D(f+g) = Df + Dg, \qquad D(af) = a Df
\end{equation*}

for any functions $f$ and $g$, and any number $a$. Because of this, $D$
behaves well with respect to linear combinations, namely
\begin{equation*}
  D(c_1 f_1 + \cdots + c_ n f_ n) = c_1 \,  D f_1 + \cdots + c_ n \,  Df_ n
\end{equation*}
for any numbers $c_1,\ldots ,c_ n$ and functions $f_1,\ldots ,f_ n$.

\begin{example}
  $Dt^3 = 3t^2$. 
\end{example}

\Warning You can't take this equation and substitute $t = 2$ to get $D8 = 12$.
The only way to interpret ``8'' in ``$D8$'' is as a constant function,
which of course has derivative zero: $D8 = 0$.
The point is that in order to know the function $Df(t)$ at a particular value of $t$,
say $t = a$, you need to know more than just $f(a)$;
you need to know how $f(t)$ is changing near $a$ as well.
This is characteristic of operators;
in general you have to expect to need to know the whole function $f(t)$ in order to evaluate an operator on it.

\begin{mydef}
  In general, a linear operator $L$ is any operator that satisfies
  \begin{equation*}
    L(f+g) = Lf + Lg, \qquad L(af) = a\, Lf
  \end{equation*}
  for any function $f$ and $g$, and any number $a$. 
\end{mydef}

\begin{example}
  The operator $L = D^2 + p(t)D + q(t)$ where $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ are
  any functions of $t$ is a linear operator. 
\end{example}
Why is $L$ linear? You know that $D$ is linear, and similarly, $D^2$ is linear.
To see that $L$ is linear, verify that a linear combination of linear operators is again a linear operator.

\clearpage
\subsubsection{Multiplying and adding operators}
To apply a product of two operators, apply each operator in succession.
For instance, $DDy$ means take the derivative of $y$, and then take the derivative of the result;
therefore we write $D ^2 y = \ddot{y}$.\\

To apply a sum of two operators, apply each operator to the function and add the results.
For instance,
\begin{equation*}
  (D^2 + D) y = D^2 y + D y = \ddot{y} + \dot{y}
\end{equation*}

Any number can be viewed as the ``multiply-by-the-number'' operator:
for instance, the operator $5$ transforms the function $\sin ⁡x$ into the function $5 \sin ⁡x$.\\

Similarly, we can multiply by any function of $t$, and this is also a linear operator.
For instance, the operator $t^2$ transforms the function $\sin ⁡x$ into the function $t ^22 \sin⁡ x$.

\begin{example}
  The ODE
\end{example}
\begin{equation*}
  2 \ddot{y} + 3 \dot{y} + 5 y = 0,
\end{equation*}
whose characteristic polynomial is $P(r) = 2r^2+3r+5$, can be rewritten as
\begin{align*}
  (2D^2 + 3D + 5) y &= 0\\
  P(D) y &= 0 
\end{align*}

The same argument shows that every constant-coefficient homogeneous linear ODE
\begin{equation*}
  a_ n y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_0 y = 0
\end{equation*}
can be written simply as
\begin{equation*}
  P(D) y = 0,
\end{equation*}
where $P$ is the characteristic polynomial.

\begin{exercise}
  Operator notation concept check
\end{exercise}
Consider the differential equation
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  \frac{d^4x}{dt^4}+2\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+x=0.
\end{equation*}
If we want to write the differential equation in the form
$P\left(D\right)x=0$, what is the differential operator $P\left(D\right)$?\\

The characteristic polynomial of the differential equation
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  \frac{d^4x}{dt^4}+2\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+x=0
\end{equation*}
is $P\left(r\right)=r^4+2r^2+1$, so the differential equation can be written in the form
$P\left(D\right) x = 0$, where
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  P\left(D\right)=D^4+2D^2+1
\end{equation*}

\begin{exercise}
  Linear operators concept check
\end{exercise}
Which of the following differential operators are linear? Check all that apply.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $4D ^n + 3$
\item $D + t ^2$
\item $D ^2 + tD + t ^2$
\item $mD ^2 + bD + k$
\item $a_0D^ n + a_1D^{n-1} + \cdots + a_ n$
\end{enumerate}

All of these operators are linear.
In particular, every linear differential equation can be written in terms of a linear differential operator.\\

The second and third choices are linear with variable coefficients.
The first, fourth, and fifth are linear with constant coefficients.\\

We'll only have formulas for solutions when the operators involved have constant coefficients.
\clearpage

\subsubsection{Time Invariance}
In this course we'll focus on polynomial differential operators with constant coefficients,
that is operators of the form
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  P\left(D\right)=a_ nD^ n+a_{n-1}D^{n-1}+\dots a_1D+a_0,
\end{equation*}

where all of the coefficients $a_k$ are numbers (as opposed to functions of $t$).
All operators of this form are linear.
In addition to being linear operators, they are also {\color{blue}time-invariant} operators, which means:
\begin{equation*}
  \text{If } x(t) \text{solves } P\left(D\right)x=f\left(t\right), \,
  \text{then } y\left(t\right)=x\left(t-t_0\right) \text{ solves }
  P\left(D\right)y=f\left(t-t_0\right)
\end{equation*}

In words, this says that ``delaying the input signal $f(t)$ by $t_0$
seconds delays the output signal $x(t)$ by $t_0$ seconds.''
If we know that $x(t)$ is a solution to $P\left(D\right)x=f\left(t\right)$,
we can solve $P\left(D\right)y=f\left(t-t_{0}\right)$ by replacing $t$ by $t - t_ 0$.
This is a useful property because gives us the solutions to many differential equations for free.

\begin{example}
  The function $x(t) = \sin (t)$ solves the differential equation
  $\dot(x) = \cos t$.  
\end{example}
What is a solution to the differential equation
\begin{equation*}
  \dot y = \cos (t +\pi /2) ?
\end{equation*}
By time-invariance, one solution is $y=\sin (t+\pi /2)$. \\
Note that
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \dot{y} &=& \cos (t + \pi / 2) \\
  \dot{y} &=& \cos t \cos \pi / 2  - \sin t \sin \pi / 2 \\
  \dot{y} &=& - \sin t 
\end{eqnarray*}

And
\begin{eqnarray*}
  y &=& \sin (t + \pi / 2) \\
  y &=& \sin t \cos  \pi / 2 + \cos t \sin  \pi / 2 \\
  y &=& \cos t 
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{example}
  Consider the differential equation
\end{example}
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  \dot{x}+x=\cos t.
\end{equation*}
Using integrating factors $e^t$
\begin{eqnarray*}
  e^t \dot{x} + e^t x &=& e^t \cos t \\
  \int (e^t x)' dt &=& \int e^t \cos t dt \footnotemark \\
  e^t x &=& \frac{e^{t}}{2} \cos t + \frac{1}{2} \sin t + c_1  \\
  x &=& \frac{1}{2} \cos t + \frac{1}{2} \sin t + c_1 e^{-t}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\footnotetext{
  $\cos t$ is a real part of $e^{it}$,
  \begin{align*}
    \int e^t \cos t dt  &= \int e^t e^{it} dt \\
                        &= \int  e^{(1 + i)t} dt \\
                        &= \frac{1}{1+i} e^{t} e^{it} + c \\
                        &= \frac{e^{t}}{2} \left( (1 - i) (\cos t + i \sin t)\right) + c \\
                        &= \frac{e^{t}}{2} \left( (1 - i) (\cos t + i \sin t)\right) + c 
  \end{align*}
  The $\mathbb{Re} \left( (1 - i) (\cos t + i \sin t)\right)$ is
  $\cos t + \sin t$.
  So,
  \begin{equation*}
    \int e^t \cos t dt = \frac{1}{2} \cos t + \frac{1}{2} \sin t + c
  \end{equation*}
}

Now suppose that we want to solve the equation $\dot{y}+y=\sin t$.
Since $\sin t=\cos \left(t-\pi /2\right)$, time invariance tells us that
\begin{align*}
  \displaystyle  y\left(t\right)
  &\displaystyle =x\left(t-\frac{\pi }{2}\right)
    =\frac12\cos \left(t-\pi /2\right) + \frac12 \sin \left(t-\pi /2\right)+c_1e^{-\left(t-\pi /2\right)} \\
  &\displaystyle =
    \frac12\sin \left(t\right) - \frac12 \cos \left(t\right)+
    \underbrace{c_1e^{\pi /2}}_{\textrm{call this }c_{2}}e^{-t} \\
  &\displaystyle =\frac12\sin \left(t\right) - \frac12 \cos \left(t\right)+c_2e^{-t}
\end{align*}

should solve $\dot{y}+y=\sin t$.
This agrees with the solution we'd get if we had used variation of parameters or integrating factors,
but we had to do almost no work to get this solution from the first.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image-LTI_function}
  \caption{LTI Function}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercise}
  LTI concept check
\end{exercise}

Which of the following differential operators are LTI operators? Check all that apply.
\begin{itemize}
\item $4D^ n + 3$
\item $D + t^2$
\item $D^2 +tD + t^2$
\item $mD^2 +bD +k$
\item $a_0D^ n + a_1D^{n-1} + \cdots + a_ n$
\end{itemize}

All of these operators are linear, and all of them that are polynomials with constant coefficients are time-invariant.
The exceptions are $tD + 2$ and $D^2 +tD + t^2$. \\
To see that $P\left(D\right)=tD + 2$ for instance is not time-invariant,
notice that the general solution to
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  P\left(D\right)x=t\dot{x}+2x=t^5
\end{equation*}
on $\left(0,+\infty \right)$ is
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  x\left(t\right)=\frac{1}{7}t^{5}+ct^{-2}
\end{equation*}

Now if the operator were time invariant, then
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  y\left(t\right)
  =x\left(t-t_{0}\right)=\frac{1}{7}\left(t-t_0\right)^{5}+c\left(t-t_0\right)^{-2}
\end{equation*}
would solve
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  t\dot{y}+2y=\left(t-t_{0}\right)^5,
\end{equation*}
for any $t_{0}>0$. However,
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle t\dot{y}+2y
  =\frac{2}{7}\left(t-t_{0}\right)^5+\frac{5}{7}t\left(t-t_{0}\right)^4
  +2c\left(t-t_0\right)^{-2}-2ct\left(t-t_{0}\right)^{-3}.
\end{equation*}
It should be clear from this that $t\dot{y}+2y\neq \left(t-t_{0}\right)^5$,
so the linear operator $tD + 2$ tD + 2.

\subsubsection{Superposition for an inhomogeneous linear ODE}
To understand the general solution $y$ to an inhomogeneous linear ODE

\begin{equation*}
  \text {inhomogeneous equation:}
  \quad p_ n(t) \,  {\color{blue}{y^{(n)}}}  + \cdots + p_0(t) \,
  {\color{blue}{y}}  = {\color{orange}{q(t)}} ,
\end{equation*}
do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item List all solutions to the associated homogeneous equation
  \begin{equation*}
    \text {homogeneous equation:}
    \quad p_ n(t) \,  {\color{blue}{y^{(n)}}}  +
    \cdots + p_0(t) \,  {\color{blue}{y}}  = 0;
  \end{equation*}
\item Find (in some way) any \textbf{one} particular solution $y_p$ to the
  \textbf{inhomogeneous} ODE.
\item Add $y_p$ to all the solutions of the homogeneous ODE to get all the solutions to the inhomogeneous ODE.
\end{enumerate}

\Summary \\
\begin{equation*}
  \underset {{\color{blue}{\text {general solution}}} }{y}
  = \underset {{\color{blue}{\text {particular solution}}} }{y_ p}
  + \underset {\text {general homogeneous solution}}{y_ h}.
\end{equation*}

Why does this work? \textbf{Proof.} Let $L$ be the linear operator
$L = p_ n(t)D^ n + \dotsb + p_1(t)D+p_0(t)$.
Then the differential equations become
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \displaystyle  \text {inhomogeneous equation} \qquad Ly
  \displaystyle &=& \displaystyle q(t) \\
  \displaystyle  \text {homogeneous equation} \qquad Ly
  \displaystyle &=& \displaystyle 0   
\end{eqnarray*}
Let $y_p$ be a particular solution to the inhomogeneous equation $L(y_p)=q$.
Let $y_h$ be a homogeneous solution $L(y_h)=0$. Then
\begin{equation*}
  L(y_ p+y_ h) =q+0=q.
\end{equation*}
Suppose that $y$ is also a solution to $Ly=q$. That is
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \displaystyle  Ly \qquad \displaystyle &=& \qquad q \\
  \displaystyle  Ly_p \qquad \displaystyle &=& \qquad q.
\end{eqnarray*}
Then it follows by linearity that
\begin{equation*}
  L(y-y_ p) = L(y)-L(y_ p) = q - q = 0
\end{equation*}
Therefore $y−y_p=y_h$ is a solution to the associated homogeneous equation. In other words,
\begin{equation*}
  y=yp+yh.
\end{equation*}

{\color{blue} The result of this section is the key point of linearity in the inhomogeneous case.}
It lets us build \textbf{all} the solutions to an inhomogeneous DE out of
\textbf{one particular solution} provided that you have already solved the associated homogeneous ODE.

\paragraph{Consequence of superposition for inhomogeneous equations}
So the {\color{blue}main theorem} about solving the inhomogeneous equation.
\begin{equation*}
  \ddot{y} + p\dot{y} + q = f(x) 
\end{equation*}
I'm going to make the left hand side a linear operator $L$.
And I'm going to write the equation
\begin{equation*}
  Ly = f(x). 
\end{equation*}
And what the theorem says is that the solution has the following form.
\begin{equation*}
  \text{Solution : } y_p + y_c\footnotemark 
\end{equation*}
\footnotetext{
  $y_c$ stands for the complementary solution.\\
  The general solution of differential equation is
  \begin{equation*}
    y = y_p + c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2 \text{, where } y_h = c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2
  \end{equation*}
}
What is $y_p$? $p$ stands for \textbf{particular}, the most confusing word in this subject.\\

The procedure for solving this equation is composed of two steps.
First, to find complementary solution $y_c$.
solve not the equation you are given, but the reduced equation.
The second step is to find $y_p$.
$y_p$ is a particular solution to the whole equation. Yeah, but which one?
Any one. Well, if it's any one, then it's not a particular solution.
So particular means any one solution.\\


First prove the theorem
It's extremely simple if you just use the fact that $L$ is a linear operator.
We've got two things to prove.
\begin{enumerate}
\item All the $y_p + c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2$ are solutions.\\
  You plug it into the equation and you see if it satisfies the equation.
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    L(y_p + c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2)
    &=& \underbrace{L(y_p)}_{f(x) \text{ since particular solution} }
        + \underbrace{L(c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2)}_{0 \text{ since homogeneous solution}} \\
    L(y_p + c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2) &=& f(x)    
  \end{eqnarray*}
  They satisfy the whole inhomogeneous differential equation
  \begin{equation*}
    L(y) = f(x).  
  \end{equation*}

\item There are no other solutions. \\
  So, Let $u(x)$ as a solution.
  \begin{equation*}
    L(u) = f(x).
  \end{equation*}
  The $L(y_p)$ is
  \begin{equation*}
    L(y_p) = f(x). 
  \end{equation*}
  Subtract two equations
  \begin{equation*}
    L(u - y_p) = 0 
  \end{equation*}
  The homogeneous solution $L(c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2) = 0$, 
  \begin{equation*}
    u - y_p = \tilde{c_1}y_1 + \tilde{c_1} y_1 
  \end{equation*}
  I'll put a $\tilde{ }$ on to indicate it's a particular one. 
  Therefor
  \begin{equation*}
    u  = y_p + \tilde{c_1}y_1 + \tilde{c_1} y_1 
  \end{equation*}  
\end{enumerate}
All we have to do is find to solve equations which are inhomogeneous,
all we have to do is find a particular solution.
Find one solution. It doesn't matter which one.
\clearpage

\subsubsection{Why exponential inputs?}
Our task for today is to find particular solutions.
We're talking about the second order equation with constant coefficients,
which you can think of as modeling springs or simple electrical circuits.
\begin{equation*}
  y'' + Ay' + By = f(x)
\end{equation*}
The problem is remember that to find a particular solution $y_p$. 
And the reason why we want to do that is then the general solution will be
of the form is $y$ equals that particular solution, plus the complementary solution
the general solution to the reduced equation,
\begin{equation*}
  y = y_p + c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2. 
\end{equation*}
So all the work depends upon finding out what that $y_p$ is.
And that's what we're going to talk about. \\

But the point is not all functions that you could write on the right-hand side are equally interesting.
There's one kind, which is far more interesting or more important in the applications than all the others.
And that's the one out of which, an arbitrary function can be built out of these simple functions.
So the important function is on the right-hand side to be able to solve it when it's a simple exponential.
But if you allow me to make it a complex exponential, so here are the important right-hand sides we want.
We want to be able to do $f(x)$ when it's of the form $e^{ax}$.
in most applications, a is not a growing exponential, but a decaying exponential.
So typically, $a < 0$, but it doesn't have to be.
That's not any assumption that I'm going to make today. It's just culture.
\begin{equation*}
   f(x) = e^{ax} \text{ or , } \left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
      \sin \omega x \\
      \cos \omega x
    \end{array} \right. 
\end{equation*}
In other words, when the right-hand side is a pure oscillation.
That's another important type of input both for electrical circuits(alternating current) or the spring systems that's a pure vibration is being. 
you're imposing a pure vibration on the spring mass dashpot system, and you want to see how it responds to that. \\

You can put them together and make these decaying oscillations.
\begin{equation*}
  f(x) =  \left\{
    \begin{array}{rl}
      e^{ax } \sin \omega x \\
      e^{ax} \cos \omega x
    \end{array} \right. 
\end{equation*}

Now, the point is all of these together are really just special cases of one general thing--
exponential if you allow the exponent not to be a real number, but to be a complex number.
So they are all special cases of
\begin{equation*}
  f(x) = e^{(a + i \omega) x}. 
\end{equation*}

If $\omega$ is $0$, then I've got $f(x) = e^{ax}$.
If $a = 0$, then I've got $\sin \omega x$ or $\cos \omega x$ separating it into its real and imaginary parts.
And if neither is $0$, I have a $e^{(a + i \omega) x}$.

But I don't want to keep writing $a + i \omega$ all the time.
So I'm going to write that simply as $e^{\alpha x}$.
And you understand that alpha is a complex number now.

\textbf{Warm-up problem: } if $r$ is a number, what is $(2D^2+3D+5) e^{rt}$?\\
\Solution First, $D e^{rt} = r e^{rt}$ and $D^2 e^{rt} = r^2 e^{rt}$ (keep applying the chain rule). Thus
\begin{align*}
  \displaystyle  (2D^2+3D+5) e^{rt}  \displaystyle &= 2 r^2 e^{rt} + 3 r e^{rt} + 5 e^{rt} \\
  \displaystyle &= (2r^2+3r+5) e^{rt}.
\end{align*}

The operator is $P(D) = 2D^2+3D+5$. Notice that $P(r) = 2r^2+3r+5$
is the characteristic polynomial. The same calculation, but with an arbitrary polynomial, proves the following general rule.

\begin{theorem}
  For any polynomial $P$ and any number $r$,
  \begin{equation*}
    {\color{blue}{P(D) e^{rt} = P(r) e^{rt}.}}
  \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Setup}
There are just a couple of basic formulas that we're going to use all the time.\\
The first is that if you apply $P(D)$ to a complex exponential or a real one-- it doesn't matter--
the answer is 
\begin{equation*}
  P(D) e^{\alpha x} = P(\alpha) e^{\alpha x}. 
\end{equation*}
The $P(\alpha)$ is now just an ordinary complex number.
So that's a basic formula.
It's called, the substitution rule, because the heart of it is you substitute for the $D$,
you substitute $\alpha$.\\

\begin{proof}
  How would I prove that?
  Well, just calculate it out.
  \begin{align*}
    \left( D^2 + AD + B\right) e^{\alpha x}
    &= D^2 e^{\alpha x} + AD e^{\alpha x} + B  e^{\alpha x} \\
    &= \alpha ^2 e^{\alpha x} + A \alpha e^{\alpha x} + B  e^{\alpha x} \\
  \end{align*}

It's obviously true for the operator $D$ and the operator $D^2$.
In other words,
\begin{equation*}
  D  e^{\alpha x} = \alpha e^{\alpha x}, \qquad D^2  e^{\alpha x} = \alpha^2 e^{\alpha x} 
\end{equation*}
And therefore, it's true for linear combinations of these as well by linearity.
So therefore, also true for $P(D)$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Exponential response formula}
\textbf{Question:} For any polynomial $P$ and any number $r$, what is a particular solution to
\begin{equation*}
  P(D)y = e^{rt}
\end{equation*}

{\color{blue} Answer(superposition):} We have
\begin{equation*}
  P(D) {\color{blue}{e^{rt}}}  = {\color{orange}{P(r) e^{rt}}} .
\end{equation*}

This is off by a factor of $P(r)$. So multiply through by $1/P(r)$ and we can use linearity to get
\begin{equation*}
  P(D)\left(\frac{1}{P(r)}e^{rt} \right) = e^{rt}.
\end{equation*}

\textbf{\color{orange} Conclusion:} This is called the {\color{blue} Exponential Response Formula (ERF).}\\
In words, for any polynomial $P$ and any number $r$ such that $P(r) \neq 0$,
\begin{equation*}
  {\color{blue}{\frac{1}{P(r)} e^{rt}}}  \quad
  \text { is a particular solution to }
  \quad P(D) y = {\color{blue}{e^{rt}}} .
\end{equation*}

Remember, this is just one particular solution.
To get the general solution, we need to add the solution to the associated homogeneous equation.

\begin{example}
  Find the general solution to $\ddot{y} + 7\dot{y} + 12 y = {\color{blue}{-5e^{2t}}}$. 
\end{example}

\Solution\\
\begin{align*}
  \text{Characteristic polynomial:} \qquad
  &P(r) = r^2+7r+12 = (r+3)(r+4)\\
  \text{Roots:} \qquad
  & -3, -4\\
  \text{General solution to \textbf{homogeneous} equation:} \qquad
  & {\color{orange}{y_ h}}  = c_1 e^{-3t} + c_2 e^{-4t}    
\end{align*}

ERF says:
\begin{equation*}
  {\color{blue}{\frac{1}{P(2)} e^{2t}}}
  \quad \text {is a particular solution to }
  \quad P(D) y = {\color{blue}{e^{2t}}} ;
\end{equation*}
i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
  {\color{blue}{\frac{1}{30} e^{2t}}}
  \quad \text { is a particular solution to }
  \quad \ddot{y} + 7 \dot{y} + 12 y = {\color{blue}{e^{2t}}} ,
\end{equation*}
so
\begin{equation*}
  \underset {{\color{blue}{ \text {call this } y_ p}} }{-\frac{1}{6} e^{2t}}
  \quad \textrm{ is a particular solution to }
  \quad \ddot{y} + 7 \dot{y} + 12 y = {\color{blue}{-5e^{2t}}} .
\end{equation*}

General solution to inhomogeneous equation:
\begin{align*}
  \displaystyle y \displaystyle &= {\color{blue}{y_ p}}  + {\color{orange}{y_ h}} \\
  \displaystyle &= -\frac{1}{6} e^{2t} + c_1 e^{-3t} + c_2 e^{-4t}.
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{ERF and complex roots}

\begin{example}
  Use ERF to find a particular solution to $\ddot x + x = e^{2it}$.
\end{example}

\Solution In operator notation, this differential equation can be written as
\begin{equation*}
  (D^2+1)y = e^{2it}.
\end{equation*}
By the ERF, a particular solution is given by
\begin{equation*}
  y_ p = \frac{e^{rt}}{r^2+1} = \frac{e^{2it}}{(2i)^2+1} = \frac{-1}{3}e^{2it}.
\end{equation*}

\begin{exercise}
  Practice problem 1
\end{exercise}
Use ERF to find a particular solution to
\begin{equation*}
  (D^2+1)y = e^{-t}.
\end{equation*}
By the ERF, a particular solution is
\begin{equation*}
  y _p = \frac{e^{-t}}{r^2 + 1} = \frac{e^{-t}}{(-1)^2 + 1} = \frac{e^{-t}}{2} 
\end{equation*}

\begin{exercise}
  Practice problem 2
\end{exercise}
Use ERF and superposition to find a particular solution to
\begin{equation*}
  (D^2+1)y = e^{-t} - 3e^{2it} .
\end{equation*}
By superposition
\begin{eqnarray*}
  (D^2+1)(c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2) &=& e^{-t} - 3e^{2it} \\
  (D^2+1)(c_1 y_1) + (D^2+1)(c_2 y_2) &=& e^{-t} - 3e^{2it} \\
  c_1 (D^2+1)(y_1) + c_2(D^2+1)(y_2) &=& e^{-t} - 3e^{2it}
\end{eqnarray*}
By ERF, the particular solution of $ c_1 (D^2+1)(y_1) = e^{-t}$ is
\begin{equation*}
  y_{1p} = \frac{e^{-t}}{r^2 + 1} = \frac{e^{-t}}{(-1)^2 + 1} = \frac{e^{-t}}{2}. 
\end{equation*}
By ERF, the particular solution of $ c_2 (D^2+1)(y_2) = -3 e^{-2it}$ is
\begin{equation*}
  -3 y_{2p} = -3 \left(\frac{e^{2it}}{r^2 + 1} \right)
  = -3 \left(\frac{e^{2it}}{(2i)^2 + 1} \right)
  = -3 \left(\frac{-1}{3} e^{2it} \right) = e^{2it}. 
\end{equation*}
The particular solution is
\begin{equation*}
  y _p = y_{1p} + y_{2p} =  \frac{e^{-t}}{2}  + e^{2it}. 
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{The generalized exponential response formula}

\begin{exercise}
  When the ERF fails
\end{exercise}
For which of the following functions $q\left(t\right)=e^{at}$ does the differential equation
$\ddot{x}+x = q(t)$ \textbf{not} have a solution of the form $Ae^{at}$?

\begin{itemize}
\item $e^t$
\item $e^{-t}$
\item $e^{it}$
\item $e^{-it}$
\item $e^{2it}$
\item $e^{3t}$
\item $1$
\end{itemize}
The characteristic polynomial is $P(r) = r^2+1$.
This polynomial is zero when $r=\pm i$.
Thus we can not apply the Exponential Response Formula to find a solution of the form
$e^{at}$ is when $a=\pm i$.\\

The existence and uniqueness theorem says that
\begin{equation*}
  P(D) y = e^{rt}
\end{equation*}
should have a solution even if $P(r) = 0$(when ERF does not apply). Let's start with the one case:\\
{\color{blue} ERF'} Suppose that $P$ is a polynomial and $P(r _0) = 0$, but
$P'(r _0) \neq 0$ for some number $r_0$. Then
\begin{equation*}
  \boxed {{\color{blue}{x_ p=\frac{1}{P'(r_0)} t e^{r_0t}}}  \
    quad \text { is a particular solution to }\quad P(D) x = {\color{blue}{e^{r_0t}}} .}
\end{equation*}

\begin{proof}
  We want to solve $P(D)y = e^{r_0t}$. We know that
  \begin{equation*}
    P(D)e^{r_0t} = P(r_0)e^{r_0t},
  \end{equation*}
  for all $r$. However, since $P(r_0)$ is zero, we cannot divide by it.\\
  Instead, let us look at what happens near this point $r_0$ and differentiate with respect to $r$.
  \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle  \displaystyle \frac{\partial }{\partial r}\left(P(D) e^{rt} \right)
    \displaystyle = \displaystyle  \frac{\partial }{\partial r}\left(P(r) e^{rt} \right)
    = P'(r)e^{rt} + P(r)te^{rt}.
  \end{equation*}
  We need to take the derivative of the left hand side. Recall that
  $\frac{\partial }{\partial r}\frac{\partial }{\partial t}
  = \frac{\partial }{\partial t}\frac{\partial }{\partial r}$.
  In this context, this means the same thing as
  \begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial }{\partial r}D =
    D\frac{\partial }{\partial r} \qquad \left(D = \frac{d}{dt} \right).
  \end{equation*}
  Hence
  \begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial }{\partial r}P(D) = P(D)\frac{\partial }{\partial r}
  \end{equation*}
  by linearity. \\
  The left hand side becomes.
  \begin{align*}
    \displaystyle  \displaystyle \frac{\partial }{\partial r}\left(P(D) e^{rt} \right)
    \displaystyle &= \displaystyle  P(D) \left( \frac{\partial }{\partial r} e^{rt}\right) \\
    \displaystyle &= \displaystyle  P(D) \left( te^{rt}\right)
  \end{align*}
  Let $r\rightarrow r_0$. Therefore since $P(r _0) = 0$
  \begin{align*}
    \displaystyle  P(D) \left( te^{r_0t}\right)
    \displaystyle &= \displaystyle  P'(r_0)e^{r_0t} + P(r_0)te^{r_0t} \\
    \displaystyle &= \displaystyle  P'(r_0)e^{r_0t}
  \end{align*}
  If $P'(r _0) \neq 0$. then we can divide through by $P'(r _0)$
  \begin{equation*}
    P(D) \left( \frac{te^{r_0t}}{P'(r_0)}\right) = e^{r_0t},
  \end{equation*}
  and $\displaystyle y_ p = \frac{te^{r_0t}}{P'(r_0)}$ is a particular solution to $P(D)y = e^{r_0t}$
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
  Find a particular solution to $\ddot{x} -4x = e^{-2t}$
\end{example}

\Solution The characteristic polynomial is $P(r) = r^2 - 4$, thus $P(-2) = 0$, But
$P'(2) = 2(-2) = -4 \ne 0$. Therefore this is a cae where we can apply ERF'.
which gives us a particular solution
\begin{equation*}
  x_ p = \frac{te^{rt}}{P'(r)} = \frac{te^{-2t}}{-4}.
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}
  Solve the system $\ddot{x} + x = e^{it}$ with initial conditions $x(0)=1$ and $\dot{x}(0) = 0$.
\end{example}
The characteristic polynomial of the differential equation $\ddot{x} + x = e^{it}$ is $P(r) = r^2 + 1$
, with roots $\pm i$.
Since $i$ is a root of the characteristic polynomial, the {\color{blue}Generalized ERF} tells
us to find the smallest integer $s$ for which $P(s)(i) \ne 0$.
In this case, $P'(r) = 2r$, so $P'(i) = 2i$, which is not zero, so $s = 1$.
The Generalized ERF tells us that
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  x_ p\left(t\right)=\frac{1}{P^{\prime }\left(i\right)}t^{1}e^{it}
  =\frac{1}{2i}te^{it}
\end{equation*}
is particular solution to the inhomogeneous ODE.
Since $\frac{1}{i} = e^{-i \pi/2}$ \footnote{
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{i} &= \frac{1}{i} \cdot \frac{i}{i} \\
    \frac{1}{i} &= -i \\
    \frac{1}{i} &= \cos (-\pi / 2) + i \sin (-\pi / 2) \\
    \frac{1}{i} &= e^{i \frac{-\pi}{2}}
                  \quad \text{where } e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin theta     
  \end{align*}
}
, we can write $x _P$ as
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  x_ p\left(t\right)=\frac{1}{2}te^{it-i\pi /2}.
\end{equation*}
Since the characteristic polynomial has roots $\pm i$, we know that the pair
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  e^{it},e^{-it}
\end{equation*}
form a basis for the space of solutions to the homogeneous equation
$\ddot{x}+x=0$.
Hence, the general solution to the inhomogeneous equation
$\ddot{x}+x=e^{it}$ is
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  x\left(t\right)
  =\underbrace{c_{1}e^{it}+c_{2}e^{-it}}_{\text {general solution to homogeneousODE}}
  +\underbrace{\frac{1}{2}te^{it-i\pi /2}.}_{{\color{orange}{\text {particular solution}}} }
\end{equation*}
Now we just need to solve for the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$
from the initial conditions initial conditions $x(0)=1$ and $\dot{x}(0) = 0$.
We see that
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  x\left(0\right)=1=c_{1}+c_{2},
\end{equation*}
so $c _2 = 1 - c _1$, and we can write $x(t)$ as
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  x\left(t\right)
  =c_{1}e^{it}+\left(1-c_{1}\right)e^{-it}+\frac{1}{2}te^{it-i\pi /2}.
\end{equation*}
We see that
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  \dot{x}\left(t\right)
  =ic_{1}e^{it}-i\left(1-c_{1}\right)e^{-it}+\frac{1}{2}e^{it-i\pi /2}+\frac{1}{2}te^{it},
\end{equation*}
so
\begin{align*}
  \displaystyle  \dot{x}\left(0\right)
  \displaystyle &=ic_{1}-i\left(1-c_{1}\right)+\frac{1}{2}e^{-i\pi /2}\\
  \displaystyle &=ic_{1}-i\left(1-c_{1}\right)-\frac{i}{2}.
\end{align*}

Using the initial condition $\dot{x}(0) = 0$ and solving for $c_1$ we see that $c_1 = 3/4$.
Substituting this into the equation $c_2 = 1 - c_1$, we see that $c_2 = 1/4$.
Thus the solution to the system $\ddot{x} + x = e^{it}$ with initial conditions $x(0)=1$ and $\dot{x}(0) = 0$
is
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  x\left(t\right)=
  \frac{3}{4}e^{it}+\frac{1}{4}e^{-it}+\frac{1}{2}te^{it-i\pi /2}.
\end{equation*}


\textbf{Generalized exponential response formula.} if $P$ is a polynomial and $r_0$ is a number
such that
\begin{equation*}
  P(r_0) = P'(r_0) = \dotsb = P^{(m-1)}(r_0) = 0 \qquad P^{(m)}(r_0) \neq 0,
\end{equation*}
then
\begin{equation*}
  P(D)\left( t^ me^{r_0t} \right) = P^{(m)}(r_0)e^{r_0t}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
  \boxed {{\color{blue}{y_ p=\frac{1}{P^{(m)}(r_0)} t^ m e^{r_0t}}}
    \quad \text { is a particular solution to }
    \quad P(D) y = {\color{blue}{e^{r_0t}}} .}
\end{equation*}

\begin{proof}
  We want to solve $P(D)y = e^{rt}$. We know that
  \begin{equation*}
    P(D)e^{r_0t} = P(r_0)e^{r_0t},
  \end{equation*}
  for all $r$. However, since $P(r_0)$ is zero, we cannot divide by it.
  Instead, let us look at what happens near this point $r_0$ and differentiate with
  respect $r$.
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \displaystyle  \displaystyle P(D)e^{rt} \qquad
    \displaystyle &=&
                      \qquad \displaystyle  P(r)e^{rt} \\
    \displaystyle \frac{\partial }{\partial r}\left(P(D)e^{rt}\right) \qquad
    \displaystyle &=&
                      \qquad \displaystyle \frac{\partial }{\partial r}\left( P(r)e^{rt}\right) \\
    \displaystyle P(D)\left(\frac{\partial }{\partial r}e^{rt}\right) \qquad
    \displaystyle &=&
                      \qquad \displaystyle  P'(r)\  e^{rt} + P(r)\  t\  e^{rt}
  \end{eqnarray*}
  In the case that $r_0$ is a repeated root with multiplicity $m$, then $P(r) = Q(r)(r-r_0)^{m}$,
  and
  \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle  \displaystyle \frac{d^{m}}{dr^ m}P(r_0) \displaystyle  \neq \quad 0,
  \end{equation*}
  however, all lower derivatives are zero at $r$
  \begin{align*}
    \displaystyle  \displaystyle \frac{d^{m-1}}{dr^{m-1}}P(r_0)
    \displaystyle  &=& \displaystyle  0 \\
    \displaystyle \quad \vdots & & \displaystyle  \vdots \\
    \displaystyle P(r_0) \displaystyle  &=& \displaystyle  0.
  \end{align*}
  Differentiate both sides of the equation $m$ times with respect to $r$ to obtain a relationship:
  \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle  \displaystyle P(D)\left(t^ m e^{rt}\right)
    \displaystyle  =
    \displaystyle  \left(P^{(m)}(r) + m\  t\  P^{(m-1)}(r)
      + \frac{m(m-1)}2 t^2P^{(m-2)}(r) + \dotsb + t^ mP(r)\right)e^{rt}
  \end{equation*}
  Evaluating at $r_0$, only the $m$th derivative term survives
  \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle  \displaystyle P(D)\left(t^ m e^{r_0t}\right)
    \displaystyle  = \displaystyle  P^{(m)}(r_0)e^{r_0t},
  \end{equation*}
  which gives a particular solution to the differential equation
  $P(D)y = e^{r_0t}$ of the form
  $\displaystyle y_ p= \frac{t^ me^{r_0t}}{P^{(m)}(r_0)}$.

\subsubsection{Worked example}
\paragraph{Linear, constant coefficient, inhomogeneous ODEs}
We'll be solving linear ODEs with constant coefficients. \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\dot{x} + kx = 1$
\item $\dot{x} + kx = e^{-5t}$
\item $\dot{x} + kx = 4 + 7 e^{-5t}$
\end{enumerate}
The first step in solving these problems is finding the homogeneous solution.
We do this by setting the right hand side equal to 0.
Actually, note that all these three problems have the same exact left hand side.
So the homogeneous solution will be common to all of them.
The characteristic polynomial of $\dot{x} + kx$ is
\begin{equation*}
  P(s) = s + k 
\end{equation*}
We find the solution to the homogeneous problem by setting
\begin{equation*}
  P(s) = s + k = k 
\end{equation*}
That will tell us that $s = -k$.
Therefore, our homogeneous solution,
\begin{equation*}
  x_h = C e^{-kt}
\end{equation*}

For part 1, now we need to find a particular solution
that satisfies the differential equation $\dot{x} + kx = 1$.  
Now, this is an equation that we can actually solve by inspection.
If we assume that $x$ is a constant, then $\dot{x} = 0$.
\begin{align*}
  0 + kx &= 1 \quad \text{ if } x = \text{constant} \\
  x &= \frac{1}{k} 
\end{align*}
We'll denote this particular solution by the subscript $a$.
So $x_a$ is the particular solution to part 1.
Now, the general solution to pat 1 would be given by
\begin{equation*}
  x = x_a + x_h = \frac{1}{k} + C e^{-kt}.
\end{equation*}
We used \textbf{the method of inspection}, and that's not the most systematic way of doing it.
But for now, I just wanted to show you that there are ways to solve ODEs that are very simple just
by looking at them.\\

Now, for part 2 we're looking $\dot{x} + kx = e^{-5t}$.
And now we use the systematic method.
We're going to use the exponential response formula, or ERF.
We can only use the ERF because the right hand side or the forcing of this equation is exponential.
In order to calculate the the particular solution $x_b$,
We take the right hand side $e^{-5t}$ and divide by the characteristic polynomial $P$,
\begin{equation*}
  x_b = \frac{e^{-5t}}{P(-5)} = \frac{e^{-5t}}{-5 + k}  
\end{equation*}
We can write the general solution to part 2 by adding the particular solution
and the homogeneous solution, that is 
\begin{equation*}
  x = C e^{-kt} + \frac{e^{-5t}}{-5 + k}. 
\end{equation*}
Note an important thing here. What happens if $k = 5$?
Then this denominator goes to $0$, and this solution is undefined.
We'll need to look at another method to solve this.
But just one last thing that I want to point out is that the ERF could also have been used here. 
if we think of $1$ as $e^{0t}$.
That's true. That's an exponential.
And if we use the exponential response formula,
we would have gotten the same answer.\\

All right so we just found a solution for part 2.
But we notice that there is a problem when $k = 5$.
So this solution actually
\begin{equation*}
  x = C e^{-kt} + \frac{e^{-5t}}{k + 5} \quad \text{if } k \ne 5.   
\end{equation*}

If $k = 5$, we're actually solving the differential equation
\begin{equation*}
  \dot{x} + 5x = e^{-5t}
\end{equation*}
Now, since we saw that the exponential response formula as we know it didn't work,
we can use the method of variation of parameters.
So for variation of parameters we need a homogeneous solution $C e^{-5t}$.
But for the method of variation of parameters we only need one homogeneous solution.
So we can take $C$ to be $1$.
So now
\begin{equation*}
  x = u(t) e^{-5t}
\end{equation*}
We plug this into our ordinary differential equation, and we get 
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{d}{dt}(u e^{-5t}) + 5ue^{-5t} = e^{-5t}
\end{equation*}
Now, we use the product rule to simplify this term, which
\begin{align*}
  \frac{du}{dt} e^{-5t}n -5ue^{-5t} + 5u e^{-5t} &= e^{-5t} \\
  \frac{du}{dt} &= e^{5t} e^{-5t} \\
  \frac{du}{dt} &= 1 \\
  \int \frac{du}{dt} &= \int 1 \\
  u = t + c
\end{align*}
Now we plug that back into our expression for $x$.
\begin{equation*}
  x = (t+c)e^{-5t} = te^{-5t} + ce^{-5t} \quad \text{where } k = 5 
\end{equation*}
Note that contains a particular solution $te^{-5t}$, as well as the homogeneous solution
$ce^{-5t}$. 
So by using the method of variation of parameters, we got both solutions at the same time.
That's a nice feat of the method a variation of parameters. \\

Now, in part 3, we're asked to solve $\dot{x} + kx = 4 + 7 e^{-5t}$.
We need to note that the right hand side is a superposition of the problems that we solved.
\begin{equation*}
  \dot{x} + kx = 4\cdot (1) + 7 \cdot e^{-5t}.
\end{equation*}
And these were the right hand sides on parts 1 and 2.
So we're solving this problem.
Because this equation is linear, we can superimpose the solutions that we found in part 1 and 2
and get the particular solution for part 3.
So the particular solution for part 3 is recovered by
\begin{equation*}
  x_c = 4 x_a + 7 x_b  
\end{equation*}
Note that, once again, this is the particular solution.
If I want the full solution, I would get the general solution by adding the particular solution plus the homogeneous solution that we found before.
\begin{equation*}
  x = 4 x_a + 7 x_b + c e^{-kt}
\end{equation*}
And this is the most general solution

\subsubsection{Review: Basis of homogeneous solutions with linear operators}
Recall the method for finding a basis of solutions to a constant-coefficient homogeneous linear ODE, now written as $P(D)y=0$. Using operators, we can explain why it works.
\begin{example}
  Consider the ODE
  \begin{equation*}
    y^{\prime \prime \prime } - 10 y^{\prime \prime } + 31y'-30y = 0.
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}
Rewriting this using operator notation we have $P(D)y = 0$, where $P(r) = r^3-10r^2+31r-30$
is the characteristic polynomial of the ODE.
The trick now is to factor the operator, and proceed from there.
The characteristic polynomial factors as $P(r) = (r-2)(r-3)(r-5)$.
The order is $3$, so the dimension of the vector space of solutions is $3$.\\

Now
\begin{align*}
  e^{2t} &\text{  is a solution since } P(D) e^{2t} = p(2) e^{2t} = 0 e^{2t} = 0 \\
  e^{3t} &\text{  is a solution since } P(D) e^{2t} = p(2) e^{3t} = 0 e^{3t} = 0 , \text{ and}\\
  e^{5t} &\text{  is a solution since } P(D) e^{5t} = p(5) e^{5t} = 0 e^{5t} = 0 
\end{align*}

Just because we wrote down $3$ solutions does not mean that they form a basis:
If we had written down $e^{2t}\, , e^{3t}\, , 4e^{2t} + 6e^{3t}$, 
then they would \textbf{not} have been a basis, because they are linearly dependent
(and their span is only $2$-dimensional).\\

To know that $e^{2t}, \, e^{3t} , \, e^{5t}$ really form a basis,
we need to know that they are {\color{orange}linearly independent.}
Could it instead be that
\begin{equation*}
  e^{5t} = c_1 e^{2t}+c_2 e^{3t} \qquad \text{(as functions)}
\end{equation*}
for some numbers $C_1, \, c_2$? \\

One way to see that is no possible is to apply $(D-2)(D-3)$ to both side,
which would give
\begin{align*}
  \displaystyle  \displaystyle (D-2)(D-3)e^{5t}
  \displaystyle &= \displaystyle  (D-2)(D-3)\left( c_1 e^{2t} + c_2 e^{3t} \right) \\
  \displaystyle &= \displaystyle  c_1(D-2)(D-3)e^{2t} + c_2 (D-2)(D-3) e^{3t}
                  \qquad \text {(by linearity)} \\
  \displaystyle &= \displaystyle  c_1\cdot 0 + c_2 \cdot 0 = 0  
\end{align*}

The left hand side gives us
\begin{equation*}
  (D-2)(D-3)e^{5t} = (5-2)(5-3) e^{5t} \neq 0.
\end{equation*}
This contradiction implies that $e^{5t}$ is not a linear combination of $e^{2t}$ and $e^{3t}$.
The same argument shows that no one of $e^{2t}, \, e^{3t} , \, e^{5t}$ is a linear combination
of the other tow. Since $e^{2t}, \, e^{3t} , \, e^{5t}$ are linearly independent,
they form a basis of a $3$-dimensional space (which must be the space of all solutions,
since that too is $3$-dimensional).

\subsubsection{Review: repeated roots with linear operators}

What about the case of repeated roots?\\

This case is less important than the others,
because if someone hands you a polynomial it's unlikely that two or more of its roots will coincide.
But it does happen, and it is interesting to think about what happens.\\

\begin{example}
  Find a basis of solutions to $D^3 y=0$. (
  The characteristic polynomial is $r^3$, whose roots with multiplicity are
  $0,\, 0,\, 0$.) 
\end{example}

\Solution Integrate three times:
\begin{align*}
  D^2 y &= c_1\\
  Dy &= c_1 t + c_2 \\
  y &= c_1 \frac{t^2}{2} + c_2 t + c_3 \\
  \displaystyle &= \underset {{\color{orange}{\textrm{general solution}}} }{C_1 t^2 + c_2 t + c_3}.          
\end{align*}
for some numbers $C_1=c_2 / 2, c_2,$ and $c_3$.
Since $t^2,\, t,\, 1$ are linearly independent, they form a basis for the space of solution.
\begin{example}
  Find a basis of solutions to $(D - 5)^3 y = 0$. 
\end{example}

\Solution \\
The characteristic polynomial is $(r-5)^3$, which a repeated root $5,\, 5,\, 5$,
so based on the previous example, we might hope that $e^{5t},\, te^{5t},\, t^2 e^{5t},\,$
are basis.
Let's now explain \textbf{why} these are solutions. \\
We know that $D - 5$ sends $e^{5t}$ to $0$.
What does $D - 5$ do to $ue^{5t}$, if $u$ is a function of $t$?
Using product rule:
\begin{align*}
  \displaystyle  (D-5) \,  u e^{5t}
  \displaystyle &= \left( \dot{u}\cdot e^{5t} + u \cdot 5 e^{5t} \right) - 5 u \cdot e^{5t} \\
  \displaystyle &= \dot{u} \cdot e^{5t}.
\end{align*}
Replacing $(D-5)$ by $(D-5)^2$ and $(D-5)^3$ on the left we get the following:
\begin{align*}
  \displaystyle  (D-5)^2 \,  u e^{5t}
  \displaystyle = \ddot{u} e^{5t}\\
  \displaystyle (D-5)^3 \,  u e^{5t}
  \displaystyle = u^{(3)} e^{5t}.
\end{align*}
So our guess was right! In order for $ue^{5t}$ to be a solution to
$(D-5)^3y = 0$ the function$u^{(3)}$ must be 0:i.e,
$u = a + bt + ct^2$ for some numbers $a,\, b,\, c,$ so the solutions are
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle u e^{5t} = a \,  e^{5t} + b \,  t e^{5t} + c \,  t^2 e^{5t},
\end{equation*}
are expected. \\

Since $1,\, t,\, t^2$ are linearly independent functions, so are $e^{5t},\, te^{5t},\, t^2 e^{5t}$
(any relation between the last there function could by divided by $e^{5t}$ to get a relation
between the first three). Thus $e^{5t},\, te^{5t},\, t^2 e^{5t}$ form a basis. \\

If a characteristic polynomial $P(r)$ has a root $r$ is repeated $k$ times, then
$e^{rt},\, te^{rt},\, t^2 e^{rt},\, \cdots ,\, t^{k-1} e^{rt}$ are independent solutions
to the differential equation $P(D)=0$. 
\clearpage

\subsubsection{Worked Examples}
\begin{example}
  Find the general solution to the differential equation
  \begin{equation*}
    2\ddot{x}+\dot{x}+x=1+2e^{t}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}

This is an inhomogeneous linear equation, so the general solution has the form
$x_p + x_h$, where $x_p$ is any particular solution and $x_h$ is the
general homogeneous solution.
The characteristic polynomial is $P(s) = 2s^2 + s + 1$, with roots$(-1 \pm \sqrt{7})/4$,
So and the general homogeneous solution is given by
\begin{align*}
  \displaystyle x_h(t)
  \displaystyle &=e^{-t/4}\left(a_1\cos \left( \frac{\sqrt {7} t}{4}\right)
                  +c_2\sin \left( \frac{\sqrt {7}t}{4}\right)\right) \\
  \displaystyle &=Ae^{-t/4}\cos \left(\frac{\sqrt {7}t}{4}-\phi \right)
                  \quad \text{ where } A = \sqrt{a_1^2 + c_2^2}
                  \quad, \phi = \arctan(c_2 / a_1)                    
\end{align*}
The inhomogeneous equation is $P(D)x = 1 + 2e^{t}$.
The input signal is a linear combination of $1$ and $e^t$,
so we can find particular solution to $P(D)x =1$ and $P(D)x = e^t$ separately,
then use superposition to construct a particular solution is $P(D) = 1 + 2e^t$.
if $x_1$ is a particular solution to $P(D)x = 1$, and $x_2$ is a particular solution
to $P(D)x = e^t$, then superposition says that a particular solution to
$P(D)x = 1 + 2e^t$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
  x_p = x_1 + 2x_2
\end{equation*}
The construct function $1$ is an exponential: $1=e^{0t}$. Thus $P(D)x = 1$ has a particular solution
\begin{equation*}
  x_1 = \frac{1}{P(0)} = 1
\end{equation*}
(More elementarily, we've learned to look for constant solutions when the right hand side is constant, and solving $P(D)c = 1$ gives $c = 1$.)\\
Similarly, the ERF tells us that
\begin{equation*}
  x_2 = \frac{1}{P(1)} e^t = \frac{1}{4} e^t  
\end{equation*}
is a particular solution to $P(D)x = e^t$. Thus
\begin{align*}
  x_p &= 1 + 2 \left( \frac{1}{4} e^t\right) \\
      &= 1 + \frac{1}{2} e^t
\end{align*}
is a particular solution to $P(D)x = 1 + 2e^t$. So the general solution
$2\ddot{x}+\dot{x}+x=1+2e^{t}$ is
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  x\left(t\right)=
  1+\frac{1}{2}e^ t+Ae^{-t/4}\cos \left(\frac{t\sqrt {7}}{4}-\phi \right).
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}
  Find a particular solution to the equation
  \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle  \ddot{x} + 8\dot{x} + 15 x = e^{-5t}
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}

The characteristic polynomial is $P(r) = r^2 + 8r + 15$. Since $P(-5) = 0$
we need to use the generalized ERF.\\

Computing we see that $P \prime (r) = 2r + 8$, and $P \prime (-5) = -2$.
Therefore the generalized ERF gives a particular solution of
\begin{equation*}
  x_p = \frac{te^{-5t}}{P \prime (-5)} = - \frac{te^{-5t}}{2}.
\end{equation*}

(Of course, there are other particular solution.)

\begin{exercise}
  ERF Concept Check
\end{exercise}
For which values $a$ does not the differential equation
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  \frac{d^5 y}{dt^5} - y = e^{at}
\end{equation*}
\textbf{not} have a solution of $ce^{at}$ for some number $c$? 


The characteristic polynomial of the differential equation
\begin{equation*}
  \displaystyle  \frac{d^5 y}{dt^5} - y = e^{at}
\end{equation*}
is $r^5 -1$, which has roots are $1,\, e^{2 \pi i / 5},\, e^{4 \pi i / 5},\, , e^{(n-1) 2 \pi i / 5}$.
When $a$ is one of these values, substituting $y = ce^{at}$ into left side of the differential
equation gives $0$, not $e^{at}$.
Thus the differential equation does \textbf{not} have a solution of the form $ce^{at}$ when
$a=1$ or $a = e^{(n-1)2 \pi/5}$.

Express $(D^3 -D)(x+y)$ as an operators acting on $x$ plus and operator action on y.
(if $(D^3 -D)(x+y) = Ax + By$, what do $A$ and $B$ equal in terms of $D$? )\\

By product rule ,
\begin{equation*}
  (D^3 -D)(x+y) = (D^3 -D)x + (D^3 -D)y  
\end{equation*}

\begin{problem}
  Superposition

Let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be two solution to $(D^3 - D)x = 0$. Which of the following are also
solution to the same equation? Choose all that apply.
\begin{itemize}
\item $x_1 - x_2$
\item $x_1 x_2$
\item $ax_1$ for any constant $a$
\item $x_2 + 1$
\item $ax_1 + bx_2$ for any two constant $a$ and $b$.
\item $x_1 + x_2 + x_1 x_2$
\end{itemize}
By superposition, the solution is form of
\begin{equation*}
  c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 \qquad \text{ where } c_1,\, c_2 \text{ is any number.}, 
\end{equation*}
and the right side is equation is $0$, so both $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be constant function.\\

The answer is
\begin{align*}
  &x_1 - x_2\\
  &ax_1 \quad \text{ for any constant } a \\
  &x_2 + 1 \\
  &ax_1 + bx_2 \quad \text{for any two constant } a\, \text{and} \,b.
\end{align*}

\begin{problem}
  Homogeneous solutions
\end{problem}
Which of the following are solutions to the homogeneous equation
$(D^3 - D)x = 0$?\\

The characteristic polynomial is
\begin{equation*}
  r^3 - r = 0
\end{equation*}
The root of $r$ is $0,\, -1,\, 1$, so the homogeneous solutions for $(D^3 - D)x$ is
\begin{equation*}
  c_1 e^{0t},\, c_2e^{t},\, \text{ and } c_3 e^{-t}.   
\end{equation*}

\begin{problem}
  Particular solutions
\end{problem}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use ERF (or generalized ERF) to find a particular solution to $(D^3 - D)x = e^{2t}$. \\
  The particular solution using ERF is
  \begin{equation*}
    x_p = \frac{e^{rt}}{P(r)} = \frac{e^{2t}}{2^3 - 2} = \frac{1}{6} e^{2t} 
  \end{equation*}
\item Use ERF (or generalized ERF) to find a particular solution to $(D^3 - D)x = e^{-t}$. \\
  The $P(r) = 0$, so suing generalized ERF is
  \begin{equation*}
    x_p = \frac{te^{rt}}{P^{\prime}(r)} = \frac{te^{-t}}{3 - 1} = \frac{1}{2} te^{-t}. 
  \end{equation*}
\item Use ERF (or generalized ERF) to find a particular solution to $(D^3 - D)x = 1$. \\
  The $(D^3 - D)x = 1 = e^{0t}$, so $r=0$.
  Using generalized ERF, $P^{ \prime} (r) = 3 r^2 - 1$. So
  The particular solution is
  \begin{equation*}
    x_p = \frac{te^{rt}}{P^{\prime} (r)} = \frac{te^{0t}}{0 - 1} = - t. 
  \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{ERF}

Use ERF to find a particular solution of $\ddot{x} + 9x = e^{3t} + 9$.\\

Let particular solution of $\ddot{x} + 9x = e^{3t}$ as $x_a$ and
$\ddot{x} + 9x = 1$ as $x_b$. \\
By superposition,  the particular solution of  a particular solution of
$\ddot{x} + 9x = e^{3t} + 9$ is
\begin{equation*}
  x_p = x_a + 9 \cdot x_b
\end{equation*}
The characteristic polynomial is $r^2 + 9$, so the particular of
$x_a$ is
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{e^{rt}}{r^2 + 9} = \frac{e^{3t}}{3^2 + 9} = \frac{e^{3t}}{18}.  
\end{equation*}
The particular solution $x_b$ is
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{e^{rt}}{r^2 + 9} = \frac{e^{0t}}{0^2 + 9} = \frac{1}{9}. 
\end{equation*}
So,
\begin{equation*}
  x_p = x_a + 9 \cdot x_b = \frac{e^{3t}}{18} + 9 \cdot \frac{1}{9} =  1 + \frac{e^{3t}}{18}.

\subsubsection{Using Operators, a Review}
\begin{problem}
  Review damped oscillators
\end{problem}
Consider the damped harmonic oscillator corresponding to the differential operator
$10D^2 + 2D + 5I$. \\
\begin{itemize}
\item If this were an undamped oscillator (damping term put to zero), find the natural angular frequency
  $\omega _n$\\
  
  The characteristic polynomial for undamped oscillator is $10r^2 + 5$.
  The roots of polynomial is $\pm i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
  The homogeneous solution is
  \begin{equation*}
    e^{i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} t},\, e^{i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} t}
  \end{equation*}
  By Eular's Formular,
  \begin{equation*}
    e^{i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} t} = \cos(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} t) + i \sin (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} t). 
  \end{equation*}
  So the natural angular frequency $\omega _n $ is $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.

\item For the damped oscillator, what is the rate $a$ of exponential decay? \\
  
  The characteristic polynomial for undamped oscillator is $10r^2 + 2r + 5$.
  The roots of polynomial is $-\frac{1}{10} \pm i \frac{7}{10}$
  The homogeneous solution is
  \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle e^{(-\frac{1}{10} + i \frac{7}{10})t},\, e^{(-\frac{1}{10} - i \frac{7}{10})t}
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{equation*}
    \displaystyle e^{(-\frac{1}{10} + i \frac{7}{10})t}
    \displaystyle = e^{(-\frac{1}{10})t} e^{(i \frac{7}{10})t}
  \end{equation*}
  So, the exponential decay $a$ is $-\frac{1}{10}$.

\item For the damped oscillator, find the angular frequency $\omega _d$?\\
  
  The angular frequency $\omega _2$ is $\frac{7}{10}$.

\subsubsection{Boston Harbor Example}

Suppose we are studying the tides in Boston Harbor.
Let $x$ the water level in Boston Harbor.
Let $y$ be the water level of the ocean.
Then the input is the ocean level $y$, which is responsible for the changing tides $x$ in Boston Harbor,
the system response.\\

\textbf{\color{blue} The Physics} \\

We assume that the ocean and the harbor are connected by a narrow channel
so that the flow is slow and not turbulent.
This allows us to assume that the flow rate is pressure driven, and is linearly proportional to the pressure difference.
Furthermore the pressure difference is linearly proportional to the difference in water level between the ocean and the harbor.

\begin{exercise}
  Modeling sinusoidal tides
\end{exercise}

Represent this system as ODEs.\\

The change in water level in the harbor is proportional to the difference in water level between the ocean
and the harbor, therefore
\begin{equation*}
  \dot{x} = k(y - x)
\end{equation*}

which is the same as
\begin{equation*}
  \dot{x} + kx = ky 
\end{equation*}

We wrote $k(y−x)$ not $k(x−y)$ because we make a habit of choosing positive parameters where possible.
We can see that $k$ must be positive because
if the water level in the ocean is higher than the water level in the harbor,
then the water level in the harbor will increase.
Similarly, if the water level in the ocean lower than the water level in the harbor,
the water level in the harbor will decrease.
Therefore the proportionality constant $k$ must be positive.
Notice that our equation is the same equation as Newton Cooling.
